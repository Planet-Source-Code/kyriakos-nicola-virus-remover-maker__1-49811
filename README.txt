Description:
THIS IS NOT A PRO REMOVER AND IT IS NOT MEND TO REPLACE ANY PRO ANTIVIRUS TOOLS.
I wrote this project because viruses are increasing dramatically and are becoming more and more
everyday and I wanted give a hand to fight them, not that this project will exinquish all the viruses
but at least it can be developed by many programmers and become a great tool for removing new viruses.

have and develop this project and again give credits for my work.
