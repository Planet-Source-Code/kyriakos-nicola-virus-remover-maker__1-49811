### Description

I wrote this project because viruses are increasing dramatically and are becoming more and more everyday and I wanted to give a hand to fight them, not that this project will exinquish all the viruses but at least it can be developed by many programmers and become a great tool for removing new viruses. Please respect my work, leave comments(important!) and if you like it vote for it.
